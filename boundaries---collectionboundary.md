### Collection Boundaries

Sometimes we need to automatically track the collective World-space boundary of a group of [Entities](). The xeoEngine [CollectionBoundary]() component makes this easy and efficient. First, we create a Collection to hold our Entities, then attach a CollectionBoundary, get the CollectionBoundary's Boundary3D, and then at any time we can query the Boundary3D for its extents. We can also attach an "updated" listener to the Boundary3D, to get a notification whenever its extents change.

To show it this works, let's start by creating a [Collection]() to hold some [Entities]():````javascriptvar collection = new XEO.Collection();````Then we'll attach a [CollectionBoundary]() to our [Collection]():````javascriptvar collectionBoundary = new XEO.CollectionBoundary({    collection: collection});````Next, we'll get the [Boundary3D]() from the [CollectionBoundary] and add a listener to it observe updates to its World-space extents:````javascriptvar worldBoundary = collectionBoundary.worldBoundary;worldBoundary.on("updated", function() {    var obb = worldBoundary.obb;    var aabb = worldBoundary.aabb;    var center = worldBoundary.center;});````Finally, we'll add three [Entities]() to our [Collection](), which will cause our [CollectionBoundary]()'s [Boundary3D]() to expand to fit them, which in turn fire our [Boundary3D]()'s "updated" listener.````javascriptvar torus = new XEO.Entity({ // Red torus    geometry: new XEO.TorusGeometry(),    material: new XEO.PhongMaterial({        diffuse: [1.0, 0.3, 0.3]    }),    transform: new XEO.Translate({        xyz: [-10, 0, 0]    })});var sphere = new XEO.Entity({ // Green sphere    geometry: new XEO.SphereGeometry(),    material: new XEO.PhongMaterial({        diffuse: [0.3, 1.0, 0.3]    }),    transform: new XEO.Translate({        xyz: [0, 0, 0]    })});var box = new XEO.Entity({ // Blue box    geometry: new XEO.BoxGeometry(),    material: new XEO.PhongMaterial({        diffuse: [0.3, 0.3, 1.0]    }),    transform: new XEO.Translate({        xyz: [10, 0, 0]    })});collection.add(torus);collection.add(sphere);collection.add(box);````#### Buffering GoodnessNote that, even though we added three [Entities]() to the [Collection](), our "updated" listener will only fire once. That's thanks to the way that xeoEngine buffers everything as tasks to it's internal FIFO task queue. The [Collection]() fires an "added" event for each Entity we add to it, which triggers the CollectionBoundary to schedule a rebuild task to the queue **if it hasn't scheduled the rebuild already**. In short, this buffering system means that three Entity additions to the [Collection]() triggers just one rebuild of the [CollectionBoundary]().
